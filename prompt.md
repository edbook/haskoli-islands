# Goals

- Review the Sphinx multi-course build setup
- Review the GitHub workflows and suggest improvements
- Remove duplicate PR workflows, only the optimized workflow should run
- Ensure no unnecessary workflows run or are in a pending state in PRs (i.e.
  publishing github releases)
- Ensure the push-to-main workflow is correctly set up
