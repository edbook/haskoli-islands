# Automatically fixes the latex output from sphinx
# (the one found in '_build/latex') and compiles it into a pdf file.
# Note that for this script to work, inkscape must be installed (as is converts the svg images!)
# and the files 'fix_latex_Tolfraedi_fra_grunni' and 'create_Tolfraedi_fra_grunni' must be
# in the same directory as the .tex files.
# To run the script, type 'bash create_Tofraedi_fra_grunni' without the quotes.

# First we run a script that cleans up the latex code,
# such as enabling .svg pictures and removing extra code.
python3 fix_latex_Tolfraedi_fra_grunni.py TfG.tex TfG_fixed.tex

# Now we compile the fixed .tex document with pdflatex. Note that we use two options:
# '--shell-escape' allows the compile to use inkscape when needed, then continue.
# '-interaction=nonstopmode' tells the compiler to ignore errors where input would be requested.
# This second setting is due to the fact that there is one such error as part of sphinx's
# redefined '\maketitle' command. I was unable to fix the error, but it seems to be harmless!
#
# Note that the following is run twice as sometimes references are not used after the first
# time the file is compiled. To see if there are any missing references, one can search
# '??' within the finished pdf, if so, something is wrong.
